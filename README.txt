Scikit-learn Tutorial (4/10/2017)


This repository consist codes and documents for the Scikit-learn library tutorial for Machine Learning modeling onto real datasets.

The purpose of this repository is to assist users to get engaged with machine learning algorithms by utilizing one of the most useful and user-friendly ML library in python: Scikit-learn.

By following instructions, users will be able to gauge a sense of how to build ML projects using algorithms and its methods for supervised/unsupervised learning and model selection/evaluations.
